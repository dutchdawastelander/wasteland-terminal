<h2>Day 22 – Settling In</h2>
<p>We’ve stayed. The world outside doesn’t call to us anymore. The cabin’s walls keep out the wind, if not the memories.</p>
<p>She spends most of her time down by the creek, collecting stones. She says she’s building something. I don’t ask what. The silence between us has changed. It used to be distance. Now it feels like truce.</p>

<h2>Day 25 – The Creek</h2>
<p>She’s made a small circle of smooth river stones—perfect ring, every rock washed clean. Inside, one word scratched into the dirt: His.</p>
<p>When she caught me looking, she said, “It’s not for you to touch.” Her voice was calm, but her hands were trembling.</p>
<p>That night she stayed outside after dark. When she came in, she smelled like rain and smoke.</p>

<h2>Day 27 – The Truth We Don’t Say</h2>
<p>I dreamed of him again.</p>
<p>We were scavenging for food—one of the last days in New York. The air was thick with dust, the streets echoing. He was with us—our son—small, curious, clutching her hand.</p>
<p>He found a can under a pile of glass, held it up to show her. The light hit his face through the cracks in the ceiling. For one small second, it looked like life again.</p>
<p>Then came the sound—claws scraping concrete, that wet, gurgling hiss. The ghoul burst through the back door, fast. Too fast. I shouted. She turned.</p>
<p>It was already on him.</p>
<p>Her scream split the air. I fired. Missed. Fired again. The bullet went through both of them.</p>
<p>When I reached them, he was already still. She was holding him, rocking back and forth, whispering his name. She kept saying, He’s warm, he’s still warm.</p>
<p>We buried him behind a ruined church two days later. The ground was frozen. She dug with her hands until her nails tore.</p>
<p>Every swing of her machete since that day has been for him.</p>

<h2>Day 29 – The Memorial</h2>
<p>She finished it. The stones stand waist-high now, with a small wooden carving on top. She planted wildflowers around the base, pale and stubborn.</p>
<p>We stood together in front of it for a long time. Neither of us spoke. Then she reached for my hand.</p>
<p>The wind moved through the trees—soft, warm, almost kind. For a moment it felt like something inside both of us finally exhaled.</p>
<p>Maybe forgiveness doesn’t need words. Maybe hope doesn’t either.</p>
