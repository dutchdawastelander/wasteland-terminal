<h2>Day 14 – The Foot of the Mountains</h2>
<p>The air smells different here—pine and damp soil instead of ash. The silence presses on the chest like the world’s holding its breath.</p>
<p>She walks ahead most of the time. Never looks back. I think she likes not having to see me.</p>
<p>At night, I catch her staring into the fire, her eyes reflecting the light but not feeling it. I ask if she’s okay. She says, “I’m fine.” She’s not.</p>

<h2>Day 15 – The Cabin</h2>
<p>We found it today—a cabin by a creek, half-eaten by moss. The chimney still stood. The door was open.</p>
<p>It smelled wrong. Not just rot—something soaked into the wood. I told her to wait. She didn’t.</p>
<p>She gripped the machete and went in first. The door slammed against the wall. A sound came from inside—wet, hungry, too fast.</p>
<p>The first feral lunged from the dark and she met it head-on, blade flashing. The sound of it hitting the floor was like meat dropped on stone. Another came from the hall, another from under the stairs.</p>
<p>She didn’t hesitate. She charged straight into them, hacking and screaming, every swing sharper, angrier, faster. It wasn’t fighting—it was exorcism.</p>
<p>When the last one fell, she didn’t stop. She kept swinging. Again. And again. Until her arms gave out and her breath came in gasps.</p>
<p>I grabbed her wrist to stop her. She turned on me like she didn’t know who I was—eyes wild, teeth bared. I had to hold her, drag her out onto the porch. She fought me until her knees hit the dirt, and then she broke.</p>
<p>We burned the bodies before dark. The smoke twisted up into the gray sky and vanished. She didn’t look away once.</p>
<p>When it was done, the forest was still. Even the wind wouldn’t come near.</p>
<p>We slept inside that night. The cabin’s ours now. It doesn’t feel like home.</p>

<h2>Day 18 – Cleaning</h2>
<p>She hasn’t stopped working. Scrubbing blood off floorboards, hammering shutters, fixing cracks that don’t matter. Her hands are torn open.</p>
<p>I told her to rest. She said, “If I stop, I’ll think.” At night she keeps the machete beside her bed. Sometimes I wake to the sound of her whispering his name.</p>
